# Installation

Install the package via composer:

```
composer require nh/mediable
```

Publish the database and the config for the media:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=mediable
```

To make a model mediable, add the **Mediable** trait to your model:
*To retrieve the media of your model => $post->media*
*To check if of your model has any media => $post->hasMedia()*

```
use Nh\Mediable\Traits\Mediable;

use Mediable;
```

If you need to resize the picture media (JPEG/PNG), add the sizes in the config **mediable.php** at **'sizes'**:

```
'posts' => [
  'fit'    => null,
  'height' => [100,200],
  'width'  => 400,800
]
```

# Add, edit and delete some media

## Add

To add some media, add in your model form the name and file inputs with the name **media_to_add**:
*The names of the inputs must be: media_to_add[KEY][name] and media_to_add[KEY][file]*

```
<label>Name of the media</label>
<input type="text" name="media_to_add[0][name]" />

<label>File to upload</label>
<input type="file" name="media_to_add[0][file]" />
```

By default the media are upload in the public disk, but you can change this in the config **mediable.php**.

The media are saved in:
- A folder with the model classname in plural *(exemple: App\Post => posts)*
- A folder with the media format name in plural *(exemple: 42.jpg => images)*
- For the images, a folder with the resize value *(exemple: 42.jpg which is resized with a 100px height => h-100)*

And the filename is set with the ID of the media.

## Edit

To edit the name of some media, add in your model form the name input with the name **media_to_edit**:
*The name of the input must be: media_to_update[KEY][name]*

```
<label>Name of the media</label>
<input type="text" name="media_to_edit[0][name]" />
```

## Delete

To delete some media, add in your model form id inputs with the name **media_to_delete**:
*The name of the input must be: media_to_delete[] and the value must be the ID*

```
<input type="checkbox" name="media_to_delete[]" value="1"/>
