# Installation

Install the package via composer:

```
composer require nh/mediable
```

Publish the database and the config for the media:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=mediable
```

To make a model mediable, add the **Mediable** trait to your model:
*To retrieve the media of your model => $post->media*
*To check if of your model has any media => $post->hasMedia()*

```
use Nh\Mediable\Traits\Mediable;

use Mediable;
```

If you need to resize the picture media (JPEG/PNG), add the sizes in the config **mediable.php** at **'sizes'**:

```
'posts' => [
  'fit'    => null,
  'height' => [100,200],
  'width'  => 400,800
]
```

By default the media are upload in the public disk, but you can change this in the config **mediable.php**.

The media are saved in:
- A folder with the model classname in plural *(exemple: App\Post => posts)*
- A folder with the media format name in plural *(exemple: 42.jpg => images)*
- For the images, a folder with the resize value *(exemple: 42.jpg which is resized with a 100px height => h-100)*

# Components view

The package come with some view components:

- MediaFieldset : to add, edit and delete some media in a form.

```
"bs-custom-file-input" : "^1.3.4",

```
window.bsCustomFileInput = require('bs-custom-file-input');
require('../../vendor/nh/bs-component/resources/js/dynamic');
